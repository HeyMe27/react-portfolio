      <p>
        I’m a Web Developer with hands-on experience working at Tata Consultancy Services for the client GE Healthcare. I’ve modernized and enhanced outdated web applications, implemented responsive designs, and improved overall performance using React.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and API integrations.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Redesigned legacy apps — updated UI/UX, branding, and color themes</li>
        <li>✅ Added modern features: image hover names, button labels, and table formatting</li>
        <li>✅ Created APIs, pagination, and improved alignment/scrolling for a clean layout</li>
        <li>✅ Boosted backend performance by 90% using Java</li>
        <li>✅ Developed REST APIs in Python and automated deployments using Jenkins</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I’m here to help you improve your web applications’ design, functionality, and speed — whether it’s building from scratch or improving existing systems.
